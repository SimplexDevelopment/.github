# Simplex Development Group

<p>
Simplex Development Group is a Java-based development team focused on providing quality APIs and libraries to developers designed to reduce boilerplate code and simplify the coding process for certain platforms.
The main focus of this development team are libraries designed for the Bukkit / Spigot / Paper API.
All of our projects are intended to be ready for developers to use out of the box with little effort and minimal documentation referencing.
Projects will still contain JavaDocs, to ensure that overall we maintain easy understandability for the code we provide.
<br>
<br>
This development team is currently focused on a large scale network project called the Freedom Network Suite, a collection of modular plugins designed for server networks designed around the "Freedom" concept; the idea that every player should have (within reason) no limitations or restrictions on the things they are allowed to do. This includes allowing free access to switching gamemode types, creating unrestricted nbt data for items, and most importantly no paywall for features like WorldEdit, GoBrush, LibsDisguises, etc.
